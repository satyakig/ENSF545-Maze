### Objectives:

The objective of this project is to determine whether we can create the conditions to induce or reduce Cybersickness in a user while they are interacting with a Virtual Reality application. A secondary goal of this project is to determine how our findings compare to the findings in the paper “Cybersickness analysis with EEG using Deep Learning Algorithms” [3, 4] and whether we can predict what kind of VR simulations might cause or reduce cybersickness. Based on our findings, it might be possible to predict and test people for motion sickness or cybersickness, using EEGs and VR devices, before they take part in an activity e.g. flying, amusement parks, etc.
